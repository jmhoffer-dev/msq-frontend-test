This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## MatchSquare Code Test

#### Setup
Fork this repo and use this React project as a starting point.  Clone to your machine and run the following from command line:

```
cd msq-frontend-test/
npm install
# yarn works too
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser if it doesn't open automatically.

Sample image assets and mock data endpoints necessary for you to begin are available in the /public path from the project root.

#### Test 1: UI layout
Refactor code and add necessary features to support UI style and layout presented in mock ups such as top level nav and product gallery.

#### Test 2: Responsiveness
Per mockups UI should dynamically update based on viewport/device.

#### Test 3: Favorites
User must be able to filter and toggle UI to present only favorites or all products.

#### Extra Credit: Animations
Make that UI pop! :)  Using an animation library of your choosing, spice things up a bit by adding some dynamic elements.  We have included the react-lottie library by AirBnB as an example.

#### Submission
Please be sure code is as generic and reusable as possible.  Linted code, unit tests, and extracted constants are a huge plus where applicable.  Any other best practices you can think of are great too.  This is your chance to show off!
